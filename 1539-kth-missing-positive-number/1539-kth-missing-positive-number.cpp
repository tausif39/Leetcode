// The array is strictly increasing - no repeating values.
// One case is, that the first element in the array is larger than k - which means all elements are larger than k.
// In this case the answer will be k.
// For example: arr = [5,6,7,8] k = 3
// the missing numbers are: [1,2,3,4] third missing number is 3 = k.
// Now, for every element that is smaller than k, if we increment k - we'll get the right answer at the end.
// Example: arr = [1,2,4,6,7] k = 3
// For the first and second elements we increment k because if we take [1,2,3,4,5...] k=3 two numbers exist in arr so we go to the next numbers.
// But now k=5, so we increment it also for 4, and so on...................
